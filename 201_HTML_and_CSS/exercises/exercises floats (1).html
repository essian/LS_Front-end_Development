    <article>
      For the floating exercises, you'll be working with two columns of different sizes. To grab some example content for both, head over to lipsum.com and generate 4 paragraphs of copy for the left column and 2 for the right column. After each description you'll find a screenshot of what your result should look like. The background colors are present to illustrate where each element ends.



    </article>

    <aside>

Create a section element that has a fixed width of 800px, and horizontally center it with CSS margin. Create two columns inside it that are positioned side to side with CSS floats, the left being an article and right being an aside. Make the article a width of 500px and the aside a width of 300px. You may want to set background colors on the body, section, article, and aside to illustrate where the boundaries are for each.
